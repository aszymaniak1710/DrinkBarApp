A Mobile Android App which is a list of drinks with its recipes, including timer functionality, and many more (in future :D). To launch, you have to download zip, unpack, open with AndroidStudio and run on Device. 

I am using Jetpack Compose to create ui, but I have also created it in XML approach. ("XML" folder ^^)
